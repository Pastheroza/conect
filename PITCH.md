## The Junior Developer You Don't Have to Hire

AI-powered multi-agent system that automates repository integration work.

---

## The Problem

When companies need to connect a frontend to a backend, or integrate multiple services, a junior developer typically spends:

- **16-24 hours** on repetitive tasks
- **$800-$1,200** in labor costs per integration

Tasks include:
- Analyzing APIs and extracting routes
- Matching frontend calls to backend endpoints
- Writing glue code and type definitions
- Setting up Docker configs and environment files

## The Solution: 5 AI Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Repo Analysis** | Clones repos, detects frameworks, extracts API routes |
| **Interface Matching** | Matches frontend API calls to backend endpoints, finds mismatches |
| **Code Generation** | Writes API clients, CORS configs, missing endpoint stubs |
| **Integration** | Generates docker-compose files and startup scripts |
| **Validation** | Checks for issues, calculates time/cost saved |

## How It Works

1. Add repositories (or entire GitHub organizations)
2. Click **Auto-Pilot**
3. Watch agents analyze, match, generate, and integrate
4. Review generated PRs with integration code

**Time: ~1 minute** vs 16-24 hours manually

## Economic Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time saved per integration | 16-23 hours |
| Cost saved per integration | $800-$1,150 |
| 10 integrations/month | **$100K+ annually** |
